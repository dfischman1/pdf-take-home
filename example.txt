To summarize, the patient has lifelong\nhistory of disruptive snoring and poor sleep quality that has worsened\nmarkedly over the last several years. She reports that in high school\nand even grade school she had difficulty staying awake in class and\nwould consume large quantities of sugar in order to assist with this,\nalthough with limited success. She ultimately obtained a aleep study\nthrough the Kaiser system in the mid-2000s. This apparently showed no\nevidence of obstructive sleep apnea, but an increased arousal index.\nWith failure to improve with conservative management, she obtained\ncoverage for a sleep study at Stanford. This was performed on September\n14, 2008, and a report from that study is available for my review. That\nstudy showed an overall apnea-hypopnea index of 51.6; respiratory events\nwere approximately 50% apneas; lowest oxygen saturation was 90%; sleep\nstage distribution showed 0.8% slow wave and 17.3% of RAM sleep. The\npatient ultimately was successful in having Kaiser get her a positive\nairway pressure therapy device that was automatically adjusting. She\nnever had a positive airway pressure therapy titration study. She used\nCPAP for a period of about 3 years but experienced sinusitis that was\nonly recognized in delayed fashion but was ultimately treated. She\ndiscontinued positive airway pressure therapy for some time but then\nresumed use. She had adjustment by someone closer to her current home\nin San Andreas after undergoing a sleep study that showed borderline\nobstructive sleep apnea. . She ultimately had empiric adjustment of her\ncurrent CPAP machine and has been using it intermittently. The patient\nSaw Dr. Riley in 2008, who recommended maxillomandibular advancement\nSurgery. The patient was unable to coverage for having the procedure\ndone by Dr. Riley. She is here today and interested in this surgery.\nShe has no current sleep medicine physician and she has never undergone\na formal positive airway pressure therapy titration study.\n\nThe patient snores on a nightly basis. It has worsened markedly but has\nbeen present most of her life. She does have witnessed apneas. She\ntypically spends 12 to 13 hours in bed on a given night. She takes up\nto 2 hours to fall asleep but her Sleep latency has decreased to 30\nminutes with trazodone. She will awaken three or more times during a\n", "52": " \n Page #2\n\ngiven night for anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes at a time, She is a\nrestless sleeper and uses all sleep positions and does not feel\nrefreshed upon waking in the morning. She has a constellation of\nmorning symptoms including dry mouth, headaches, choking or gasping,\nnasal blockage, excessive sweating, and chest pain. She has severe\nlimitation in daily activities due to fatigue and drinks two caffeinated\nbeverages per day. Her Epworth sleepiness scale score today is 24 out\nof 24. She has severe decrement in sleep-related quality of life\naccording to her functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire scores. She\ndenies symptoms of restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy, or cataplexy, but\nreports history of night terrors and other sleep disturbances dating\nback to childhood. She has maximal disturbance as reported by the nasal\nobstruction symptom evaluation and has bilateral chronic nasal\nobstruction.\n\nFor full details of past medical history, medications, allergies, social\nand family histories, and comprehensive review of systems, please see\nintake form today. .\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: PTSD, hip surgery, tonsillectomy, third molar\nextractions.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Cymbalta, temazepam, trazodone.\n\nALLERGIES: Penicillin.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: One drink of alcohol per month. No tobacco or\nrecreational drugs.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Shows bruising tendency, chest pains as described\nabove, sore throats, nosebleeds, trouble swallowing, recent weight gain,\nand fatigue.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\n\nVital Signs: Height 5 feet 1 inch, weight 169 pounds. Respiratory rate\n12.\n\nGeneral: Well-developed, overweight female in no acute distress. Voice\nstrong; no hoarseness.\n\nEars: Tympanic membranes intact. Middle ears clear bilaterally.\n\nNose: Nasal profile normal width with no lateral nasal wall collapse.\nSeptum mildly deviated left. Mild bilateral inferior turbinate\nhypertrophy on anterior rhinoscopy.\n\nOral Cavity: Tonsils absent. Palate and uvula are normal without\nexcess length. Tongue is slightly large, modified Mallampati position\n3. Mild mandibular insufficiency.\n\nNeck: No masses or lymphadenopathy.\n\nCranial Nerves: 2 through 7 and 9 through 12 intact grossly.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n\ni. Severe obstructive sleep apnea. I had a long discussion with the\npatient and her friend who accompanied her today about the\npathophysiology, consequences, and treatment options for obstructive\nSleep apnea. Her Stanford sleep study shows evidence of significant\nobstructive sleep apnea and I encouraged her to obtain her care there.\nShe has never had a positive airway pressure therapy titration study and\nthat certainly would be the next step for her. From the standpoint of\nalternative options, she understands the benefits of weight loss and\nwill continue in her attempts to accomplish that. Regarding\nmaxillomandibular advancement, there is a chance that I may be leaving\nUCSF; as such, would refer her to Dr. Janice Lee, a name with which the\npatient ia already familiar, were she to undergo maxillomandibular\nadvancement. At this time, however, I think proceeding directly to\nSurgery might be a little bit premature given that she has not had a\ncomplete trial of positive airway pressure therapy.\n\n2. Disorder of initiating and maintaining sleep.\n", "53": " \n Page #3\n\n3. Other sleep disturbances including night: terrors related to PTSD.\nThe importance of these other Sleep disturbances in the patient\u2019s poor\nsleep quality and level of daytime functioning cannot be underestimated.\nBecause of the complex interplay, I think a primary sleep physician is\nan absolute necessity. My reluctance to move forward with surgery is\nbased on the fact that these other factors do exist and that the patient\nmay be compromising her significant improvement following surgery if\nthey are not adequately treated. She expressed her understanding and\nwill move forward accordingly.\n\nERIC J.

The attending\nagreed with the findings and plan of care as documented in this note.\n\nIDENTIFICATION: This is a followup clinic visit for this 33-year-old female with signs and\nsymptoms of femoral acetabular impingement in her right hip. She is here for followup.\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY: The patient had an MRI and MR arthrogram of the right hip performed\non November 11, 2004. Impression was that of a high signal crossing the anterior superior\nlabrum which may represent a small tear. The remainder of the labrum was thought to be\nnormal.\n\nThe patient was also to begin pool therapy after the last visit; however, the patient held off\nwanting to know the results of the MRI at this visit prior to beginning any sort of therapy\nprogram. She did do physical therapy for the right groin pain before, but she did not feel that it\nhelped her, although it did somewhat help her mechanical low back pain. She has been able to\nbegin doing some cycling activities which she was unable to do at the last visit in early October.\nShe still feels a sense of \u201cfullness\u201d in her right groin like it is full of \u201csocks\u201d. When she flexes\nher hip and then extends it, she feels sometimes a pop deep in the groin area of her right hip.\nHowever, given that, she is still able to do her cycling exercise classes without significant\nproblems. At times her hip will still subluxate out of joint when she walks, and she will need to\n\u201cpop it back in\u201d.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: GENERAL: A pleasant 33-year-old female in no acute distress who\nappears stated age. MUSCULOSKELETAL: On inspection, the patient\u2019s iliac crests are noted\nto be level. RANGE OF MOTION: Right hip internal rotation 40 degrees, external 50 degrees.\nHip flexion 110 degrees with right hip pain. Abduction to 60 degrees and adduction to 50\ndegrees. SPECIAL TESTING: The patient does have a positive femoral acetabular\nimpingement test with adduction and internal rotation of the right hip. The patient\u2019s Faber\u2019s test\nis negative bilaterally for groin pain.\n\nASSESSMENT: This is a 33-year-old female with a finding of anterior superior labral tear with\nfemoral acetabular impingement on exam.\n\nPLAN: The patient will be referred to Health South for pool therapy to work on a hip girdle and\nknee stretching and strengthening program. She is also to be shown a land-based program for\nstrengthening her hip musculature. She will be placed on Mobic 7.5 mg p.o. daily.

Impression was that of a high signal crossing the anterior superior\nlabrum which may represent a small tear. The remainder of the labrum was thought to be\nnormal.\n\nThe patient was also to begin pool therapy after the last visit; however, the patient held off\nwanting to know the results of the MRI at this visit prior to beginning any sort of therapy\nprogram. She did do physical therapy for the right groin pain before, but she did not feel that it\nhelped her, although it did somewhat help her mechanical low back pain. She has been able to\nbegin doing some cycling activities which she was unable to do at the last visit in early October.\nShe still feels a sense of \u201cfullness\u201d in her right groin like it is full of \u201csocks\u201d. When she flexes\nher hip and then extends it, she feels sometimes a pop deep in the groin area of her right hip.\nHowever, given that, she is still able to do her cycling exercise classes without significant\nproblems. At times her hip will still subluxate out of joint when she walks, and she will need to\n\u201cpop it back in\u201d.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: GENERAL: A pleasant 33-year-old female in no acute distress who\nappears stated age. MUSCULOSKELETAL: On inspection, the patient\u2019s iliac crests are noted\nto be level. RANGE OF MOTION: Right hip internal rotation 40 degrees, external 50 degrees.\nHip flexion 110 degrees with right hip pain. Abduction to 60 degrees and adduction to 50\ndegrees. SPECIAL TESTING: The patient does have a positive femoral acetabular\nimpingement test with adduction and internal rotation of the right hip. The patient\u2019s Faber\u2019s test\nis negative bilaterally for groin pain.\n\nASSESSMENT: This is a 33-year-old female with a finding of anterior superior labral tear with\nfemoral acetabular impingement on exam.\n\nPLAN: The patient will be referred to Health South for pool therapy to work on a hip girdle and\nknee stretching and strengthening program. She is also to be shown a land-based program for\nstrengthening her hip musculature. She will be placed on Mobic 7.5 mg p.o. daily.

She was first\nseen in the physical medicine and rehabilitation sports medicine clinic on June 17, 2004. The\nimpression at that time was that the patient has signs and symptoms consistent with lumbar\nmechanical dysfunction and pinching of the anterior hip capsule. She returns for a fol owup visit.\n\nINTERVAL HISTORY: The patient underwent physical therapy in Portola Valley. She\nunderwent deep tissue mobilization of the low back and hip, range of motion exercises, core\nstrengthening exercises, and posture training. The patient reports that the physical therapy has\nprovided significant improvement to her low back pain. She has been utilizing the posture\ntechniques that she learned in therapy. She reports with improved posturing of her back, she\nclaims less pulling sensation at her right hip. She has not been cycling or swimming since her\nlast visit; however, she reports increased tolerance to elliptical exercises. She is currently using\nthe elliptical for 20 to 30 minutes 2 to 3 times a week with no exacerbation to the pain in her\nright hip. This is significantly improved from prior to her last visit when she was only able to\ntolerate 1 time a week elliptical training for less than 20 minutes. She does report, however, that\nany increased duration of exercise would bring the recurrence of the grinding and inflamed\nsensation and tightness in her right hip. For her low back, she reports 80% improvement in pain.\nShe has increased her standing tolerance. She reports no significant impairment while standing as\n\na hairdresser 8 hours a day.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is alert, pleasant, not in any acute\ndistress. MUSCULOSKELETAL: Right hip range of motion demonstrates internal rotation to 40\ndegrees, external rotation to 50 degrees, hip flexion to 110 degrees with right hip pain, abduction\nto 60 degrees and adduction to 50 degrees. The patient complains of reproducible right hip pain\nupon performance of the acetabular impingement test, when the right hip is adducted internally\nrotated. Strength to the right hip, knee extensor, knee flexors bilaterally is 5/5.\n\nASSESSMENT: This is a 31-year-old female with lumbar mechanical dysfunction and\ncomplaints of right hip pain. Since having physical therapy, she reports a small improvement in\nher right hip and significant improvement in her low back pain. In light of the small\nimprovement in her right hip pain, a further testing for femoral acetabular hip impingement is\nwarranted. Therefore, our plan is as follows.\n\n1. We will order an MRI scan/arthrogram of the right hip capsule and look for labral tear.\n2. X-rays of the right hip were taken at an outside facility.
